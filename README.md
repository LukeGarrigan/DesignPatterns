# DesignPatterns
A repository with all design patterns used in Java, it's a work in progress. New patterns will be added as and when I learn them, so far some of the code I've committed for certain patterns haven't been generic, meaning they are specific to a certain problem as I feel it's easier to understand this way. Eventually, this repository will contain the design pattern standalone and the design pattern implemented in a specific scenario. 
## Strategy:
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer: 
The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Decorator:
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Factory:
defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Singleton:
Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## Command:
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
